// Compile the program in Listing 6-1 (mem_segments.c), and list its size using ls â€“l.
// Although the program contains an array (mbuf) that is around 10 MB in size, the
// executable file is much smaller than this. Why is this?
//
// ANSWER: The program occupies less space on disk due to the fact that globBuff and
// mbuf are initialzied global arrays, so they end up in the bss section of the process.
//
// DISCLAIMER: I've included the C version of this program to compare the result of Zig
// and C, because Zig doesn't have static variable like C.
//
// To compile the C program use `zig cc process/mem_segments.c -O2`
// To compile the Zig program use `zig build-exe process/mem_segments.zig -O ReleaseSmall`
//
// After compiling you should see pretty similar sizes, they will not be the same, cause
// the zig compiler behavies differently than the C compiler.
//
// Open to better ways to show this behaviour!
